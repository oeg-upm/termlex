# Termlex, an OntoLex-lemon module to represent terminologies

This repository is intended to collect material that supports the development of the Termlex module, a an extension proposal of OntoLex-lemon to cover the current gaps regarding the publication of terminological resources in Semantic Web formats.
The work started in October 2020 as part of the NexusLinguarum Action (http://nexuslinguarum.eu/), that supported the development with the founding of an short term scientific mission amongst the main institutions behind the work: UPM (Universidad Politécnica de Madrid) and DFKI (Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz).
